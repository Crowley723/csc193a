            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <p>I am Brynn, I have my own <a href="https://crowleybrynn.com" target="__blank">website</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Crowley723/crowleybrynnSite">Source code</a>) and I host quite a few services on my linux server. (I really gotta stop telling people that)</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://csc130.crowleybrynn.com/" target="__blank">An over-the-top front end for my groups csc 130 project.</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The shop items are loaded from a database using ajax.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/Crowley723/csc130-project3">Source Code</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://csc131.crowleybrynn.com/" target="__blank">My csc131 project. All the workflows work,including login/signup, forum posts/likes, and events load from a database</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The login/signup feature was the feature I worked on, but since the page is hosted on my server I took a very active role in helping my groupmates (who had limited webdev skills) learn the skills and build functional features. The login/signup feature features input validation, password hashing (Bcrypt), and integrates with the other features to disallow 'guest' users from creating/liking posts.</li>

            <p>As you can see, I am quite full of myself and can't resist sharing what I have done. The process of learning linux, then docker, then the various networking concepts that go into managing a server like this has been a very interesting and enlightening journey that I continue to pursue and enjoy. <br>
            I am quite excited to learn more about web development and hopefully learn things that help me in the future.<br><br>
            I think I have rambled on quite a lot and I would be suprised if you read all this, I know how busy you must be.<br>
            <strong>As a side note, if things like this are too much, I would be happy to dial it back and just meet the requirement for assignments.</strong><br></p>
